  This change enables the target allocator to process discovered targets asynchronously. 
  This is a significant performance improvement for the target allocator, as it allows it to process targets in parallel, rather than sequentially. 
  This change also introduces new metrics to track the performance of the target allocator.
    - opentelemetry_allocator_process_targets_duration_seconds: The duration of the process targets operation.
    - opentelemetry_allocator_process_target_groups_duration_seconds: The duration of the process target groups operation.
