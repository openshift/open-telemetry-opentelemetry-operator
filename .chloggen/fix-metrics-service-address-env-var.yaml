  This should allow the metrics service address to have the host portion expanded from an environment variable,
  like `$(env:POD_IP)` instead of using `0.0.0.0`, which is the [recommended by the Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/security-best-practices.md#safeguards-against-denial-of-service-attacks).
