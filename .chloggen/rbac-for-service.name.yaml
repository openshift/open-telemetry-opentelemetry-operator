  The k8sattributes processor recently added support for automatic service.name resource attribute generation.
  This change ensures that when service.name is configured in the k8sattributes processor, the operator
  automatically adds the necessary RBAC rules for replicasets access, which is required for extracting
  k8s.deployment.name.
